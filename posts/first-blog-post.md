# Scavanger Hunt Around RMIT

## An Explosive Cup Of Coffee
![Coffee](Coffee.jpeg)

Through insider knowledge, and bit of curiosity we head outside of RMIT building to stumble upon a small cafe, "Little bang". The unique logo of a steaming cup of joe inside a silhouette of a bomb creates an explosive cup of coffee suitable to tick this off the list.

## A Book Containing Digital Media Wisdom, Found Amongst Many
![Books](Book.jpeg)

With a little help and a lot of patience, we followed instructions from the guardians of the library to follow a trail leading to the designated book that holds the key to all digital media wisdom.

## A Wide Net Strung Above, Bulging Under the weight of its flying paper cargo

Hanging right above our heads all these times, stealthy watching over everyone passing by, you will only notice it when you look up or when you see things from a higher perspective... *Hint from the library window*


## A Curtain Of Roots, Delivered By A Winged Wisitor
![Roots](Roots.jpeg)

A random pop up wall, covered with growing tree roots, amost magnificent to look at, something you wouldn't expect a small tiny space corner with no much reason behind it's growth... Well sometimes its better to keep your nose away and enjoy the beauty of nature.

## A Door For The Condemned

A majestic gateway to put the condemned behind... Walking out of the gateway give you a taste of freedom, with the lights shining upon you as if the gods are giving you a permission to be free once again from all your responsibilities...

## A Study Space Fit For A Sith Lord

A daunting place of study, enveloped by futuristic seat and table design making you feel as if you are Darth Vader emerging from his meditation chamber... *Spookyyy*

## The Disembodied Hands Of A Great Ape

Is it an ape? or a gorilla? Well we never got the answers to that during the scavanger hunt, thougt it made a great comfy seat for Dash!

## A Basement-dwelling Black Box, Bigger That You Might Think
![Black Box](Box.jpeg)

Honestly, at first we are kinda looking for a "*physical box*" but at a ridiculouse size... But we are told by some fellow students that the Black Box we are looking for is the room right behind us... Sooo... YEEPIE!


## A Wide Machine, Dispensing Beverages From A Far Away Land
![Vending Machine](Vending.jpeg)

A seemingly unlimited source of beverages... still wondering where those drinks come from?

## A Golden Globe Atop A Tower Of Eights
![Golden Globe](Globe.jpeg)

Wasn't The Golden Globe I had in mind when first hearing about it(*Was thinking of the Korean Golden Globe Awards*)...But let me tell you it is A "GRAND STATUE OF THE GOLDEN GLOBE" it is majestic in the clear sky and sunlight reflecting of it... *P.S To the person who made this scavanger hunt it's very cheeky of you this one is tough... But aint enough for us*

... which can be written inline, like this: $\{ x, y, z \} \in \N$

... or block, like this:

$$ x^2 + y^2 = z^2 $$
